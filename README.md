## About This Collection

As a former literature student, I've always been captivated by the power of a well-crafted sentence. Words can build worlds, distill complex emotions, and preserve moments in time. This repository is my personal hoard of those powerful words, a digital commonplace book where I collect the lines from novels, plays, and poems that have resonated with me.

This project is also a practical exercise in my journey to learn software development. Each quote added is another step in mastering the Git workflow, from my local machine in **VS Code** to the world via **GitHub**.

## Within These Digital Pages

* **[`quotes.md`](quotes.md):** The heart of the collection. Here you'll find the curated list of quotes, organised by author and work.

## A Word of Welcome

Feel free to browse the collection. I hope you find a line that makes you think, remember a story you loved, or discover a new author to explore. This is a living project, and it will grow and change as I continue my reading journey.

Happy reading!
